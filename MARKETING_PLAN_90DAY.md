## Executive Summary

### The Strategy in One Sentence

Build a content machine on YouTube that provides massive free value (strategy backtests + build-in-public), captures leads via a free automation guide, nurtures them through email, and converts them through a 7-day free trial — while simultaneously recruiting strategy creators who bring their own audiences.

### Key Principles (Alex Hormozi Framework)

1. **Give Away Insane Value for Free** — Your content should be so good that people feel obligated to buy
2. **Volume Wins** — More content = more surface area = more discovery
3. **Proof Stacking** — Every piece of content should demonstrate that your product works
4. **Risk Reversal** — Remove all friction and fear from the buying decision
5. **Creator-Led Distribution** — Acquire creators who bring their own audiences

### Primary Goal

Demonstrate traction to VCs through:
- 50+ paying subscribers
- Growing MRR trend
- Active creator marketplace
- Engaged community
- Content library showing expertise

## Current State Analysis

### Assets We Have

| Asset | Status | Strength |
|-------|--------|----------|
| YouTube (atomiktrades25) | 5K+ subscribers, inactive | HIGH - Not shadowbanned, existing audience |
| TikTok (@atomiktrades) | New, clean account | MEDIUM - Fresh start |
| X (@atomiktrades) | 200 followers | MEDIUM - Business account |
| Discord Community | Active | HIGH - Existing engaged users |
| Product | Live, functional | HIGH - Real users, real revenue |
| Creator Case Study | $7,500 earned, 15+ subs | HIGH - Proof that it works |
| Founder Credibility | 10 years trading experience | HIGH - Authority positioning |

### Assets to Abandon

| Asset | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| X (@elcapitan1488) | Handle triggers content moderation (1488 is flagged), shadowbanned |
| TikTok (@atomiktrading) | Confirmed shadowbanned |
| TikTok (@crvz.14) | Personal viewing only |
| LinkedIn | Wrong audience for retail traders |

### Current Gaps

1. **No lead capture mechanism** — Traffic comes and goes without capture
2. **No email list** — Can't nurture or retarget interested users
3. **Limited proof** — Need more testimonials, results, case studies
4. **Spread too thin** — 8+ accounts across 6 platforms with no momentum
5. **Inactive content** — YouTube dormant, inconsistent posting elsewhere

### The Two Main Objections We Must Overcome

1. **"Is it worth $129/month?"** — Price objection (really an ROI/value perception issue)
2. **"Does it actually work?"** — Trust/proof objection

---

## Platform Strategy

### Platform Priority Matrix

| Priority | Platform | Account | Purpose | Time Allocation |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| PRIMARY | YouTube | atomiktrades25 | Long-form value content, authority building | 70% |
| SECONDARY | TikTok | @atomiktrades | Short-form clips, discovery | 10% |
| SECONDARY | X | @atomiktrades | Clips, threads, engagement | 10% |
| SECONDARY | Instagram | @atomiktrades | Reels (same as TikTok) | 5% |
| COMMUNITY | Discord | Atomik server | Bottom-of-funnel, social proof | 5% |

### Why YouTube is Primary

1. **Existing Asset** — 5K subscribers who already know you
2. **Not Shadowbanned** — Clean account, algorithm will reward good content
3. **Long-Form Works** — Trading/finance content performs well in long format
4. **Searchability** — YouTube is the #2 search engine; your videos get found forever
5. **Authority Building** — 15-minute videos build more trust than 60-second clips
6. **Repurposing Hub** — One long video becomes 5-10 short clips

### Content Repurposing Flow

```
1 YouTube Video (15-20 min)
         │
         ├──► 5-7 TikTok clips (best 30-90 sec moments)
         │
         ├──► 5-7 Instagram Reels (same clips)
         │
         ├──► 5-7 X video clips (same clips)
         │
         ├──► 1-2 X threads (key insights as text)
         │
         ├──► 1 email newsletter (summary + link)
         │
         └──► 1 Discord post (link + discussion prompt)
```

**One piece of content becomes 20+ pieces across platforms.**

## Content Strategy

### The Two Content Pillars

#### Pillar 1: "Strategy Autopsy" Series (60% of content)

Backtest and analyze popular trading strategies with brutal honesty.

**Format:**
1. Take a popular strategy (TradingView, YouTube traders, Reddit)
2. Backtest it with real data
3. Show actual win rate, drawdown, profit factor, expectancy
4. Be brutally honest — if it sucks, say it sucks
5. End with CTA: "Want to automate a strategy that actually works? Link in bio"

**Why This Works:**
- Provides massive value (people pay consultants for this analysis)
- Positions you as the unbiased expert
- Creates controversy and engagement
- Naturally leads to "what strategies DO work?" → Atomik marketplace
- Tagging original strategy creators gives you exposure to their audience

**Example Titles:**
- "I Backtested the Most Popular TradingView Strategy (Here's the Truth)"
- "This Reddit Trading Strategy Made $47,000... Or Did It?"
- "The Strategy Everyone Uses That Actually Loses Money"
- "I Tested 5 'Profitable' Strategies So You Don't Have To"

#### Pillar 2: "Building Atomik" Series (40% of content)

Document the journey of building the company.

**Format:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly updates
- Share real numbers (MRR, users, challenges)
- Behind-the-scenes of building features
- Creator success stories
- Vulnerable moments and lessons learned

**Why This Works:**
- Creates emotional connection with audience
- Attracts other founders/builders (potential users)
- Attracts VCs who love founder stories
- Differentiates from faceless competitors
- Endless content (just document what you're already doing)

**Example Titles:**
- "I Disappeared to Build This (Why I'm Back)"
- "Month 1: $X MRR - Here's Everything I Learned"
- "A Creator Just Made $7,500 on My Platform (Here's How)"
- "The Feature That Almost Broke Everything"
- "From 20 to 50 Users: What Actually Worked"

### The Comeback Video (Your First Video Back)

**Title:** "I Disappeared to Build This (Here's What Happened)"

**Structure:**
1. **Hook (0-30 sec):** "I've been gone for X months. Here's why."
2. **The Story (1-3 min):** Trading for 10 years, got tired of manual trading, learned to code, built automation for myself, realized others needed this
3. **The Product (3-5 min):** Quick demo of Atomik — what it does, who it's for
4. **The Proof (2-3 min):** Creator case study ($7,500), your own results
5. **What's Coming (1-2 min):** Tease the content series (strategy autopsies, build in public)
6. **CTA (30 sec):** "Subscribe for weekly strategy breakdowns. Link in bio for free automation guide."

### Content Calendar Template

| Day | YouTube | Shorts (TikTok/Reels/X) | Other |
|-----|---------|-------------------------|-------|
| Monday | Upload Video #1 | 2 clips from Video #1 | — |
| Tuesday | — | 2 clips | X thread |

| Thursday | Upload Video #2 | 2 clips from Video #2 | Email newsletter |
| Friday | — | 2 clips | — |
| Saturday | Batch filming | — | — |
| Sunday | Editing | — | — |

**Weekly Output:**
- 2 YouTube videos
- 10-14 short clips across platforms
- 1-2 X threads
- 1 email to list

## Email Nurture Sequence

### Overview

- **Length:** 7 emails over 14 days
- **Goal:** Build trust, demonstrate value, overcome objections, drive to free trial
- **Tone:** Conversational, direct, value-focused

### Email 1: Welcome + Deliver Lead Magnet (Immediate)

**Subject:** Your automation blueprint is ready

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Here's your free Strategy Automation Blueprint:

[WATCH THE VIDEO HERE]

In this 20-minute guide, I walk you through exactly how to set up
your first automated trading strategy — from TradingView alert to
executed trade.

Quick background on me: I've been trading for almost 10 years.
Started manually, got tired of the emotional rollercoaster, taught
myself to code, and automated everything. Then I realized other
traders needed this too — so I built Atomik.

Over the next couple weeks, I'll share more insights on automation,
some real strategy breakdowns, and a few things I wish I knew when
I started.

For now, watch the blueprint and let me know if you have questions.

Talk soon,
Cruz

P.S. If you want to see automated strategies running live, join
our Discord: [LINK]. We post real trade signals there.
```

### Email 2: The Problem with Manual Trading (Day 2)

**Subject:** Why most traders lose (it's not the strategy)

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Here's something I learned after 10 years of trading:

The strategy isn't the problem. You are.

I don't mean that as an insult. I mean that human psychology is
fundamentally incompatible with consistent trading.

You see a trade going against you, and you move your stop loss.
You see profits, and you close early. You miss an entry, and you
chase. You have a bad day, and you revenge trade.

Every trader does this. It's not a character flaw — it's how
our brains are wired.

The only solution I've found: remove yourself from the equation.

When a machine executes your rules, it doesn't feel fear. It
doesn't get greedy. It doesn't revenge trade after a loss.

It just executes. Every time. Exactly as programmed.

That's why I automated my trading. And that's why I built Atomik
— so you can do the same without learning to code.

Tomorrow I'll share a real example of what's possible.

Cruz
```

### Email 3: The $7,500 Creator Story (Day 4)

**Subject:** He made $7,500 selling his strategy

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Quick story about what's possible with automation.

One of the creators on Atomik — I'll call him J — had a strategy
he'd been trading profitably for a while. He wanted to share it
but didn't want to:

- Build his own platform
- Handle payments
- Deal with infrastructure
- Manage subscriptions

So he listed it on Atomik's marketplace.

Today he has 15+ paying subscribers and has earned over $7,500
in subscription revenue. We handle everything — he just trades
his strategy and collects checks.

The cool part? His subscribers don't just get signals. They get
AUTOMATED execution. His strategy runs on their accounts directly.

No copying trades. No missed entries. No emotional interference.

This is the model I'm building: creators monetize their edge,
subscribers get verified automation, everyone wins.

If you have a strategy that works, you could do the same. If you
don't, you could subscribe to one that does.

Either way, it starts with a free trial: [LINK]

Cruz

P.S. J's results are public and verified. On Atomik, performance
is tracked automatically — no fake screenshots, no cherry-picked
trades.
```

### Email 4: How Atomik is Different (Day 7)

**Subject:** Why I didn't use the other platforms

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

Before I built Atomik, I tried everything else:

❌ Coded my own bots — worked, but took months and broke constantly
❌ Used signal-copying services — latency killed my edge
❌ Tried automation platforms — charged $0.50+ per trade (killed profitability)
❌ Hired developers — expensive and they didn't understand trading

So I built what I actually needed:

✓ No coding required — connect TradingView alerts with webhooks
✓ No per-trade fees — flat monthly subscription, execute unlimited
✓ Non-custodial — we never touch your funds, trades execute in YOUR broker
✓ Verified performance — cryptographic proof of what actually ran
✓ Works with prop firms — manage multiple funded accounts

The last point matters if you trade funded accounts. Atomik is
designed to work within prop firm rules.

If you've been looking for a way to automate without the BS,
this is it.

```

### Email 5: Objection Handling — The Price (Day 9)

**Subject:** Is $129/month worth it? (Let's do the math)

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

$129/month sounds like a lot. I get it.

Let's do some quick math:

$129/month = $4.30/day

Now ask yourself:

• If automation prevents ONE emotional mistake per month, what's
  that worth? (Probably way more than $129)

• If you execute 100 trades/month on a per-trade platform at
  $0.50 each, that's $50 in fees. 200 trades = $100.
  With Atomik: $129 flat. Unlimited trades.

• If you're manually trading, you're glued to charts for hours.
  What's your time worth? Even at $20/hour, 10 hours saved = $200.

• If you manage funded accounts, one blown account costs
  $100-$500 in reset fees. Automation = consistency = fewer resets.

The way I see it: $129/month is a rounding error compared to
what most traders lose from emotional decisions.

But I know you need to see it work first. That's why we have
a 7-day free trial. Full access. Real execution.

```

### Email 6: Discord Invitation + Social Proof (Day 11)

**Subject:** See it running live (Discord invite inside)

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

I've sent you a lot of info. Now let me show you proof.

Join our Discord and see:

• Live trade signals from Atomik strategies (in real-time)
• Real users discussing their setups
• Me answering questions and helping with onboarding
• Performance logs from active strategies

This isn't a polished sales page. It's the actual community
where real traders run real automation.

Join here: [DISCORD LINK]

If you want to see automation working before you commit to
a trial, this is the place.

See you inside,
Cruz
```

### Email 7: Final CTA + Urgency (Day 14)

**Subject:** Last call (then I'll leave you alone)

**Body:**
```
Hey [First Name],

This is my last email in this sequence.

Here's where we are:

✓ You've seen how automation works (the blueprint)
✓ You've heard the case for removing emotions from trading
✓ You've seen proof ($7,500 creator, live Discord signals)
✓ You know what makes Atomik different

The only thing left is to try it.

7-day free trial. Full access. Real execution in your broker.

If it's not for you, cancel before day 7 and pay nothing.

Start here: [TRIAL LINK]

If you have questions, just reply to this email. I read everything.

Cruz

P.S. If now isn't the right time, no worries. I'll keep sending
occasional strategy breakdowns and updates. You can always
start the trial later when you're ready.
```

## Creator Acquisition Playbook

### Why Creators Are Your Key Lever

Creators bring their own audiences. Every creator you onboard is essentially free distribution. Instead of paying for ads, you're splitting revenue with people who already have trust and reach.

**One creator with 1,000 followers = 1,000 potential Atomik users you didn't have to find.**

### Target Creator Profiles

| Type | Where to Find | What They Want |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| TradingView strategy publishers | TradingView scripts section | Monetization beyond one-time sales |
| YouTube trading educators | YouTube search | Passive income, credibility boost |
| Discord signal providers | Trading Discords | Infrastructure they don't have to build |
| Twitter/X traders | X search, fintwit | Monetization, verification |
| Reddit strategy posters | r/algotrading, r/daytrading | Audience, legitimacy |

### The "Feature First" Method (Non-Spammy Outreach)

**Step 1: Identify Target Creators (Build a list of 50+)**

Search for:
- TradingView scripts with high ratings
- YouTube videos with "my trading strategy" or "how I trade"
- Reddit posts sharing detailed strategies
- Twitter accounts posting trade ideas with followings

**Step 2: Create Content Featuring Them**

- Backtest one of their public strategies in your "Strategy Autopsy" series
- Be fair and honest in your analysis
- Tag them in the video/post
- Make them look good (or at least be respectful if results are poor)

**Step 3: Send The Soft Outreach DM**

```
Hey [Name],

Big fan of your [strategy/content]. I actually featured your
[strategy name] in a video I just posted — backtested it and
broke down the numbers.

Thought you'd want to see it: [LINK]

No ask here, just wanted to share. Keep up the great work.

— Cruz
```

**Step 4: Build The Relationship**

- They'll likely respond positively (you gave them free exposure)
- Engage with their content genuinely over the next 1-2 weeks
- Comment on their posts, share their stuff

**Step 5: The Partnership Pitch**

```
Hey [Name],

Following up — that video did well. Your strategy actually
performs better than most I've tested.

Quick question: have you ever thought about monetizing your
strategies beyond [however they currently monetize]?

I run Atomik — a platform that lets creators like you list
strategies on a verified marketplace. One of our creators
just crossed $7,500 in subscription revenue.

We handle all the infrastructure — payments, execution,
verification. You keep 80%.

Would you be open to a 15-min call to see if it's a fit?

Either way, keep putting out great content.

— Cruz
```

### Daily Outreach Quota

| Activity | Quantity | Time |
|----------|----------|------|
| Identify new creators | 2/day | 5 min |
| Engage with creator content | 5/day | 10 min |
| Send soft outreach DMs | 2/day | 5 min |

Keep a simple spreadsheet:

| Creator | Platform | Followers | Strategy Type | Featured in Content? | DM Sent | Response | Status |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|---------|----------|--------|
| @example | Twitter | 5K | Momentum | Yes - Video #3 | 12/20 | Positive | Call scheduled |

---

## Offer & Objection Handling

### The Two Main Objections

1. **"Is it worth $129/month?"** — Price/value objection
2. **"Does it actually work?"** — Trust/proof objection

### Overcoming "Does It Actually Work?"

This is a proof problem. Stack so much evidence that the objection becomes absurd.

**Proof Stack (In Order of Priority):**

| Proof Type | Status | Action Needed |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| Live Discord trade signals | ✅ Have | Keep showcasing |
| Creator case study ($7,500) | ✅ Have | Create content around it |
| Creator video testimonial | ⏳ Pending | Follow up with creator |
| Your own trading results | 🔲 Missing | Document and share |
| User testimonials (text) | 🔲 Missing | DM 5 users and ask |
| Strategy backtest content | 🔲 Missing | Create in content series |
| Live trade execution videos | 🔲 Missing | Screen record demos |

**Homework This Week:**
DM 5 current paying users with:
> "Hey, quick favor — would you mind sharing a sentence or two about your experience with Atomik? Just looking to share real feedback. Totally understand if not."

Add responses to landing page and marketing materials.

### Overcoming "Is It Worth $129/month?"

**Strategy 1: ROI Framing**

Always frame price against the cost of NOT using it:

> "$129/month = $4.30/day"
>
> "If automation prevents ONE emotional mistake per month, it pays for itself."
>
> "Most per-trade platforms charge $0.50+. Execute 260 trades/month and you'd pay $130 in fees. Atomik: $129 flat. Unlimited."

**Strategy 2: Lean Into Free Trial**

Your 7-day free trial is your strongest weapon. Make it the hero:

> "Try everything free for 7 days. Full access. Real execution."
>
> "You won't be charged until day 8. Cancel anytime with one click."

**Strategy 3: Compare to Alternatives**

| Alternative | Cost | Downside |
|-------------|------|----------|
| Building your own bots | Months of time + $$$$ | Maintenance nightmare |
| Per-trade platforms | $0.50+/trade | Kills profitability at volume |
| Signal copying services | $50-200/month | Latency, no verification |
| Hiring developers | $5,000-50,000+ | Expensive, slow, risky |
| Atomik | $129/month flat | — |

### The Free Trial (Your Best Conversion Tool)

**Current:** 7-day trial with credit card required

**Messaging to Use:**
- "7-day free trial. Full access. Real execution."
- "You won't be charged until day 8."
- "Cancel anytime with one click — no questions asked."

**In-App:**
Make the cancel button easy to find. Counterintuitively, this increases trust and reduces churn anxiety.

## Final Notes

### Mindset Reminders

1. **Consistency beats perfection.** A mediocre video posted is better than a perfect video never made.

2. **Volume is the strategy.** Hormozi's advice: "The market will tell you what it wants. You just have to give it enough options to choose from."

3. **Give away the secrets.** The more value you give for free, the more people trust you. They'll pay for convenience and implementation.

4. **Document, don't create.** You're already building Atomik. Just document the journey. Endless content.

5. **Play the long game.** Day 1-30 will feel slow. By day 60-90, compounding kicks in.

### When You Feel Stuck

- **Can't think of video ideas?** Backtest a popular strategy. Document what you did today.
- **No engagement?** Keep posting. Algorithms reward consistency over time.
- **Creators not responding?** Feature them first. Give before you ask.
- **Low conversions?** Add more proof. Stack more testimonials.
